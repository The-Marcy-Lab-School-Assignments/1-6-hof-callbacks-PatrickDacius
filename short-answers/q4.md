# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
A inline function is a function that uses a method and executes the logic of that function in one line. For example like a Declarative code an example of this is 
```js
const doubledNums = [1, 5, 10].map((num) => num * 2)
```

An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
